The wrong Co-Founder kills a company. The right Co-Founder can make all the difference

I am looking for the best

## Why a Co-Founder is so important

In my opinion you don't need a co-founder. But you want a great one. Better no co-founder than a bad one. I've seen this first hand.

Building a company is extraordinarily hard. It's usually almost a decade long journey a MASSIVE emotional rollercoaster and incredibly demanding in terms of growth and ability. There's no room for slack.

Having two crazy, obsessed people drastically increases your chances. It exponentially increases how fast you move and how long you stay.

But all of this is true only if you have someone dedicated to doing this for almost a decade
## What makes a great Founder (and Co-Founder)

In my opinion, a great co-founder has these traits:
1. **Driven**. And I don't just mean they work a little extra. I mean obsessed. Building a startup isn't just hard, sometimes the decision to keep going is quite literally illogical. You need to actually want to build simply because it should exist
2. **A little crazy**. You need to be a little crazy. If you're not a little crazy, you're going to give up when things get hard. This is also my personal style. When things get hard I tend to step up instead of backwards (Getting on a 1 way plane to SF for example to push myself to be a better founder)
3. **Technical** Depends on the product but this is usually an advantage. For Ardent it's effectively a must (unless you have deep knowledge of the domain + will sprint to drive sales/some non-technical engine). TLDR: Be technical. It's good
4. **Character** I need to like who you are. Maybe others don't but I do. I need to like being around you and see you as an equal. For me I want honest, willing to give back, and just generally a damn good person.

I'm sure there are more traits but these are the ones I think are most important.
## About me and Building

I've been building startups for the last 3 years, deep learning models for 4. I'm highly technical with an obession with deep learning models. 

I built our core Computer Vision algorithms at ReVision(Revisionpropertyai.com) while in my Masters at Cornell. We interviewed with YC and were finalists for Cornell's Spinout awards. Close to a partnership with the 29th largest REIT in the country

Have built both solo and with co-founders. I understand the co-founder dynamics I'm looking for and what makes or breaks those relationships.

Turned down my offers a year ago to build full time. 

I'm absolutely sure this is what I want to do with my life.

## Final thoughts

I'm trying to build an extraordinary company with extraordinary people. 

That's what I'm looking for. I want to ship and iterate at insane speeds and build a generational company.

I'm looking for the most driven, crazy, technical, and good people to join me.

If that's you, please reach out. 

Let's build something extraordinary together.
